# Introduction

This README instructs to use code in that repo to deploy a Pritunl VPN server on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Terraform. Also, we will leverage the Identity-Aware Proxy to provide secure SSH access to the VM instance, a final step to configure Pritunl VPN server.

## Client-site VPN

A client-site VPN establishes a secure and encrypted connection between a user and a private network, typically the organization's internal network. The use of a client-site Virtual Private Network (VPN) can be justified for several reasons: Enhanced Security, Remote Access, Protection on Public Networks, Data Privacy and Compliance, Securing Sensitive Transactions, Access Control, Reduced Cybersecurity Risks, etc.

## Pritunl VPN 

The Pritunl VPN is an open-source solution that provides an intuitive and secure platform for the implementation of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), emphasizing ease of use and administration. [Pritunl VPN](https://pritunl.com/)

## Terraform

Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that allows for the automated and declarative provisioning and management of infrastructure resources. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)

## Google Cloud Platform

The Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a cloud computing services platform from Google, which includes storage, data processing, machine learning, analytics, and various other resources to facilitate the development, deployment, and scalability of applications. [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/gcp)

### Identity-Aware Proxy

With TCP forwarding, IAP can protect SSH and RDP access to your VMs hosted on Google Cloud. Your VM instances don't even need public IP addresses.

## Requirements

* Terraform. [See how to install Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install)

* A Google Cloud Platform project. For that all you need is a @gmail account and a credit card (Is totally charge safe, different other cloud cloud providers, you wonâ€™t be charged until you upgrade/remove lock). You can use this link to claim $300 in free credits, [Try Google Cloud Platform for free](https://cloud.google.com/free). Also I recommend read [Creating and managing projects](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects).

* A GCP service account key with the necessary permissions to create GCP resources. You can create a service account key from the GCP Console. [Create a GCP service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create). **NOTE: Save the SA Json file outside the project directory to prevent accidental commits.**

## Note:

**The script that installs Pritunl is specific to an OS, in this case, Ubuntu 2204 LTS, so if you plan to use another image OS image, keep in mind to update the script to fit the OS you are using.**

## Deploy a Pritunl VPN instance on GCP by Terraform

The following Terraform code deploys a Pritunl VPN server on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/marcelotpcosta/terraform-pritunl-vpn
  ```

2. Into the directory:
  ```
  cd terraform-pritunl-vpn
  ```

3. Variables: Rename the `terraform.tfvars.txt` to `terraform.tfvars`, fill the variables values and save it:
  ```
  credentials_path = "<path-to-service-account-key>"
  project_id       = "<your-gcp-project-id>"
  region           = "<gcp-region>"
  zone             = "<gcp-zone>"
  server_port      = "<server-port>"
  instance_type    = "<instance-type>"
  server_name      = "<server-name>"
  ```

Note that the `variables.tf` file contains the list of variables used by .tfvars configuration file.

- `credentials`: The path to your GCP service account json key file;
- `project_id`: Your GCP project ID;
- `region`: The GCP region where the resources will be created;
- `zone`: The GCP zone where the resources will be created;
- `server_port`: Server port through which VPN clients will be connected;
- `instance_type`: The intance size;
- `server_name`: Server name (GCP console and OS hostname).

4. Initialize the Terraform:
  ```
  terraform init
  ```

5. Apply the Terraform:
  ```
  terraform apply
  ```

6. Pritunl setup:

After resources creation, the output will show the public IP to access the Pritunl web interface, so access the Pritunl web interface and follow this instructions to the basic and secure configuration.
